  - Skills

  - Detailed work experience

  - Personal projects, with references of inspiration and progress

## Development
I will develop the website as much as I can by myself, as part of a personal project, with the intention of (re) learning some tools.

The development is divided into different stages, the high level road map is as follows:

1. **Simple Homepage.**
Simplified version of the Homepage.
  - Design the Wireframe and the elements.
  - Use simple HTML.
  - Define the Jekyll Structure.
2. **Enhance Design.** From the visual design perspective, enhance the website.
  - Basic CSS Styling.
3. **Work Experience.** Section with the details of my work experience.
